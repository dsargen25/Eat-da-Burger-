  ## Installation:
  AFter cloning or unzipping the repo, cd into the "develop" directory in a bash terminal with node.js istalled. Type "npm i" to install packages from the package.json (which includes Express.js.) You must also go into the db folder and use mysql cli or mysql workbench to add schema and seed the data in the schema and seed files, respectively. After typing and entering "node server.js" go to "localhost:3000" in your web browser to start using the application.

  ## Usage:
  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has an "Eat It" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
